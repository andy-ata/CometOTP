CometOTP is a powerful two-factor authentication App for Android.

It implements Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) like specified in RFC 6238.  
Simply scan the QR code and login with the generated 6-digit code. 

This is a fork of the great OTP Authenticator app written by Bruno Bierbaumer,
which has sadly been inactive since 2015. All credit for the original version
goes to Bruno.

## Features:

 * Free and Open-Source
 * Requires minimal permissions
   - Camera access for QR code scanning
   - Storage access for import and export of the database
 * Encrypted storage
 * Multiple backup options:
   - Plain-text
   - Password-protected
   - OpenPGP-encrypted
 * Sleek minimalistic Material Design with a Dark and Light theme
 * Great Usability
 * Compatible with Google Authenticator

## Backups:

To keep your account information as secure as possible CometOTP only stores it in
encrypted data files. A part of the encryption key used for that is stored in the
Android KeyStore system. The advantage of this approach is that the key is kept
separate from the apps data and, as a bonus, can be backed by hardware cryptography
(if your device supports this).

However, due to that separation, backups with 3rd-party apps like Titanium Backup can not
be used with CometOTP. Such apps only backup the encrypted data files and not the encryption
key, which renders them useless.

**Please only use the internal backup functions provided by andOTP to backup your accounts!**
**Everything else WILL result in data loss.**

### Opening the backups on your PC:

 * [OpenPGP](http://openpgp.org/): OpenPGP can be used to easily decrypt the OpenPGP-encrypted backups on your PC.
 * [andOTP-decrypt](https://github.com/asmw/andOTP-decrypt): A python script written by @asmw to decrypt password-protected backups on your PC (needs more testing).
